# Shop-Cart Project

An application that simulate parts of an online shopping website shop cart.

### Reflection

Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to add products to Shop-cart, Eliminate, increase or decrease the number and calculate the price of products in the cart and finally clear the cart or confirm it.

I used vanilla JS and Css for building this project.
